Reverse Words in a String

Given an input string s, reverse the order of the words.

A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words in s will be separated by at least one space.

Return a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space.

Note that s may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words. The returned string should only have a single space separating the words. Do not include any extra spaces.
 

Example 1:

Input: s = "the sky is blue"
Output: "blue is sky the"
	
	
	 public String reverseWords(String s) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String[] strs = s.split(" ");
        String prefix = "";
        for(int i=strs.length-1; i>=0;i--) {
            if(!strs[i].isEmpty()) {
                sb.append(prefix);
                sb.append(strs[i]);
            }
            prefix = " ";
        }
        return sb.toString();
    }
