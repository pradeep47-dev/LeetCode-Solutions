Maximum Width of Binary Tree

Given a binary tree, write a function to get the maximum width of the given tree. The width of a tree is the maximum width among all levels. The binary tree has the same structure as a full binary tree, but some nodes are null.

The width of one level is defined as the length between the end-nodes (the leftmost and right most non-null nodes in the level, where the null nodes between the end-nodes are also counted into the length calculation.

Example 1:

Input: 

           1
         /   \
        3     2
       / \     \  
      5   3     9 

Output: 4
Explanation: The maximum width existing in the third level with the length 4 (5,3,null,9).

Example 2:

Input: 

          1
         /  
        3    
       / \       
      5   3     

Output: 2
Explanation: The maximum width existing in the third level with the length 2 (5,3).


// considering binary tree as an array 
// the root begins from the position with index 1 in the array
// If the index of a node is i, the indices of its two children are 2*i and 2*i + 1. 
// using two arrays (start[] and end[]) to record the indices of leftmost node and rightmost node in each level, 
// For each level of the tree, the width is end[level] - start[level] + 1. 


   public int widthOfBinaryTree(TreeNode root) {
        return dfs(root, 0, 1, new ArrayList<Integer>(), new ArrayList<Integer>());
    }
    
     public int dfs(TreeNode root, int level, int order, List<Integer> start, List<Integer> end){
        if(root == null)return 0;
        if(start.size() == level){
            start.add(order); 
			end.add(order);
        }
        else 
			end.set(level, order);
		
        int cur = end.get(level) - start.get(level) + 1;
        int left = dfs(root.left, level + 1, 2*order, start, end);
        int right = dfs(root.right, level + 1, 2*order + 1, start, end);
        return Math.max(cur, Math.max(left, right));
    }
